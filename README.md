Project Overview
This project demonstrates the design and reasoning behind a voice-based AI system for Indian regional languages.
The focus is on system thinking, failure awareness, cost estimation, ethical responsibility, and proof of ownership, rather than building a full end-to-end system.
All audio, analysis, and code in this project are self-generated.

Self-Generated Audio
Language: Tamil with English code-switching
Speakers: 2
Duration: 3–5 minutes
Environment: Indoor room with natural background noise
Emotional Shift: Calm to stressed/frustrated
The audio file is recorded personally and used throughout the assignment.

Manual Transcription
A 60-second segment of the audio was manually transcribed.
No speech-to-text or AI tools were used.
Difficult words, cultural expressions, and emotional cues were highlighted.
This step ensures human-first understanding before automation.

System Architecture
A voice-to-summary system architecture was designed with the following principles:
No single LLM call
Graceful degradation support
Partial and offline failure handling
English summary output

The architecture includes:
Audio chunking
Speech-to-text processing
Language and emotion analysis
Summarization
Cost awareness
Implemented Module
Module Chosen: Cost Estimation Module
This module estimates the processing cost for a 5-minute audio input by calculating:
Speech-to-text processing cost
Summarization cost
Only one module was implemented, as required.
No end-to-end system was built.

How to Run the Code
Requirements
Python 3.x
Steps
Open terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the project folder.
Run the following command:

python cost_estimation.py

The estimated cost output will be printed in the terminal.

Output
The program prints:
Audio duration
ASR cost
Summarization cost
Total estimated cost
Terminal output or screenshots are included as proof.

Screen Recording (Proof of Ownership)
A 15–30 minute screen recording is provided showing:
Audio file
Manual transcription
Architecture explanation
Code editing
Code execution
Output logs
Verbal explanation of approach
Assumptions
Audio quality is reasonably clear.
Cost values are estimated and may vary in real-world deployment.
Processing is based on average usage assumptions.
Ethical Considerations
User consent and data privacy are mandatory.
Human review is required for sensitive use cases.
Accountability lies with the organization deploying the system.

Declaration
I declare that this work is entirely my own.
No AI tools were used to generate transcription, explanations, or code logic.
I take full ownership of all decisions, assumptions, and implementations in this submission.# Newton-technology-Final-assignment-
